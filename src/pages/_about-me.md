## About me

I conceive, develop and put into production applications that solve business challenges, using Python, Machine Learning techniques and applying DevOps best practices.

I am  a cloud native developer with first-hand experience building upon technologies like Google Cloud Platform, Dataiku, Palantir Foundry, Snowflake and Streamlit.

I enjoy pursuing side projects such as [Quantified Self](https://quantified-self.streamlitapp.com/) or the [Dividend Chart](https://twitter.com/DividendChart) Twitter bot, and recently started writing in my [Digital Garden](/digital-garden/intro) for anyone to read and hopefully find some value in it.

Beyond from my passion and curiosity for technology, I also dedicate time to read [non-fiction books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/72504649-hugo-le-moine?shelf=read&sort=date_read), learn Mandarin, do [photography](https://www.instagram.com/hugo_le_moine/), running or trying to be smart with my investments.
