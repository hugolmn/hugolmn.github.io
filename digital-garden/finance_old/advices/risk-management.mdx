# Risk management

- Spread over many platforms and asset managers. If you are rich: deposits are covered up to 60kâ‚¬ per bank or broker. Having multiple life insurances in France can also allow you to unlock money from the one with the least capital gains if you really need to get liquidity.
Many ETF providers: relying on a single one coudld go wrong if the company goes burst, discontinues some ETFs, changes fees, changes index etc. --> Makes adaptation easier.
