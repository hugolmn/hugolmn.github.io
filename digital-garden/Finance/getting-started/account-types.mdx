## CTO
**Acronym**: Compte Titre Ordinaire *(Regular Securities Account)*.

The Pros:
- Maximum flexibility: you can buy or sell any open-market day, and transfer money anytime you need.
- Maximum choice of ETFs and stocks: the only limit being the ones listed by your broker.
- No account limit: you can open accounts with multiple brokers.

The Cons:
- No tax benefit: profits and dividends are taxed a flat 30% (or 17.2% + your [TMI](./prerequisites#taxable-income-and-tmi) if more favorable).
- Dividends from foreign sources have to be declared annually on your tax form to avoid double taxation (by France + other country).
- Accounts opened in foreign countries also have to be declared when filing your taxes.

## PEA
**Acronym**: Plan d'Epargne en Actions *(Share Savings Plan)*.

The Pros:
- Tax benefit: only 17.2% social taxes on realized profits
- No taxation as long as the money stays in the account (except for foreign dividends taxed at source).
- Taxation only on amounts withdrawn. Example: if your account had 15k€ of cumulative deposits, and is now worth 20k€, your account has 75% of initial capital and 25% of capital gains. If you withdraw 2k€ from this account, it corresponds to 1.5k€ of initial capital and 0.5k€ of profits. You would pay taxes only on these 0.5k€ of profits. 
- Some ETFs that use synthetic replication are eligible for this account even if the tracked index is not based in the EU.
- Transaction fees are capped by french-law at 0.5% of the transaction amount.

The Cons:
- Restricted to European Union stocks, and ETFs with at least 75% invested in EU stocks.
- Withdrawal within the first 5 years after opening the account: loss of tax benefit (a 30% flat tax is applied) and the account is automatically liquidated and closed.
- If you have deep pockets: cumulative deposits are limited to 150k€.
- Limited to one account.

:::tip

Open a PEA as soon as you can even if you don't invest right away: tax-benefits are based on the account seniority.

:::

## PEA-PME
**Acronym**: Plan d'Epargne en Actions - Petites et Moyennes Entreprises.

Pros & Cons: Same as the PEA, but restricted to small and medium size businesses (SMB). 

SMB that qualify for the PEA-PME have to be based in the EU, and match one of these criteria.
- Less than 5k employees and revenue under 1.5B€ or balance sheet under 2B€.
- Market capitalization under 1B€.

Cumulative deposits on a PEA-PME are limited to 225k€, and the cumulative deposits on a PEA and a PEA-PME are also capped at 225k€.
 
:::tip

Only open a PEA-PME if you intend to buy eligible **small cap** stocks, and if you plan to exceed the limit of 150k€ of deposits of the regular PEA.

## Assurance vie
**Meaning**: Life Insurance.

The Pros:
- Tax benefit: 17.2% social taxes + 7.5% flat tax on realized profits 
- Taxation only on amounts withdrawn. Example: if your account had 15k€ of cumulative deposits, and is now worth 20k€, your account has 75% of initial capital and 25% of capital gains. If you withdraw 2k€ from this account, it corresponds to 1.5k€ of initial capital and 0.5k€ of profits. You would pay taxes only on these 0.5k€ of profits.
- If you withdraw from contracts older than 8 years: you only pay taxes on profits above 4 600€ (or 9200€ if you file taxes with your partner). This can be applied every year, but the amount is global: withdrawing from one or more contracts does not matter.
- Optimized for inheritance (reduced taxes).
- No account limit: you can open accounts with multiple brokers.

The Cons:
- Withdrawal within the first 8 years after opening the account: loss of tax benefit (a 30% flat tax is applied)
- If you have deep pockets: deposits beyond 150k€ (over all your life insurance contracts) are also subject to the 30% flat tax.

## PER
**Acronym**: Plan d'Epargne Retraite *(Retirement Savings Plan)*.

If you work for a French company, you may already have one (also called PERCO ou PERCOL, but different from PEE).

The Pros:
- Tax benefit: deposits can reduce your taxable income (up to 10%, with a minimum of 4 399€ as of 2024). If your taxable income for the current year was 40k€ but you transfered 4k€ into your PER (and selected "versement déductible"), your income tax will only be calculated on 36k€.
- You can transfer funds from one account to another: useful when your employer's PER has very high fees or poor choices of investments.
- Optimized for inheritance (reduced taxes).
- No account limit: you can open accounts with multiple brokers.

The Cons:
- Funds are locked until retirement, purchase of your primary residence, disability (you, your partner or your children), death (you or your partner), expiration of unemployment benefits, over-indebtedness or liquidation of your own company. 
- If you chose to reduce your taxable income, defered income tax are still due when withdrawing money (only in the case of retirement or purchase of your primary residence).

:::tip

Deferring part of your income tax allows you to **invest more** now, and pay back the taxes you owe later.
