## Boursorama
**Available accounts:** CTO, PEA, PEA-PME, Assurance Vie, PER

The Pros:
- Consistently one of the cheapest banks (I'm a client since 2015).
- Opening account is extremely fast and convenient if your already have a Boursorama account.
- PER in autopilot and low fees accessible from 50‚Ç¨/month.
- ETFs from [iShares](https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/trackers/recherche/?beginnerEtfSearch%5Beligibility%5D%5B%5D=partners&beginnerEtfSearch%5Bcurrent%5D=synthesis&beginnerEtfSearch%5Bsaving%5D=0) available with no transaction fee.

The Cons:
- Transaction fees are quite high for the CTO: minimum 6.95‚Ç¨ for American stock exchanges, 11.95‚Ç¨ for European stock markets (except Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels).

Open a Boursorama account and get 80‚Ç¨ on your first transfer of >300‚Ç¨ using [my referral link](https://bour.so/q23gRmkgW8). *For transparency: I would receive 30‚Ç¨.*


## Saxo
**Available accounts:** CTO, PEA, PEA-PME

Open an account and get 500‚Ç¨ of transactions fee offered during your first 90 days using [my referral link](https://www.home.saxo/fr-fr/accounts/openaccount#refcode=JY%2bEjiq1oqtfdjMEFSDgyxC5YggtcQIx%2bwpiMZXayqludSIt%2f3hKXCpe2oCPZkjU&refid=55c1c8b5-c20b-4b36-8f08-e05110bada8f). *For transparency: I would enjoy the exact same benefits as you.*


## Degiro
**Available accounts:** CTO

The Pros:
- Wide choice of stocks and ETFs.
- Transaction fee: 2‚Ç¨ for French, Canadian and US stocks.
- Preview of impending dividends.
- Detailed charts and company data.

The Cons:
- Significant increase in transaction fees: from 0.5‚Ç¨ to 1‚Ç¨ in 2022, to 2‚Ç¨ in 2023.
- Foreign broker: account has to be declared when filing your taxes.
- No IFU (Imprim√© Fiscal Unique) that would simplify filing your taxes.


**Conclusion**: I no longer recommend Degiro.

If you still insist, you can ppen an account and get 100‚Ç¨ of transactions fee offered during your first 90 days using [my referral link](https://www.degiro.fr/parrainage/commencez-a-investir?id=15163681&utm_source=mgm). *For transparency: I would receive 50‚Ç¨ after you have accumulated 5‚Ç¨ of transaction fees.*
