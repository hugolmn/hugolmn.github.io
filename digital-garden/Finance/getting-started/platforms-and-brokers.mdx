## Boursorama
**Available accounts:** CTO, PEA, PEA-PME, Assurance Vie, PER

The Pros:
- Consistently one of the cheapest banks (I'm a client since 2015).
- Opening account is extremely fast and convenient if your already have a Boursorama account.
- PER in autopilot and low fees accessible from 50‚Ç¨/month.
- ETFs from [iShares](https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/trackers/recherche/?beginnerEtfSearch%5Beligibility%5D%5B%5D=partners&beginnerEtfSearch%5Bcurrent%5D=synthesis&beginnerEtfSearch%5Bsaving%5D=0) available with no transaction fee.

The Cons:
- Transaction fees are quite high for the CTO: minimum 6.95‚Ç¨ for American stock exchanges, 11.95‚Ç¨ for European stock markets (except Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels).

Open a Boursorama account and get 80‚Ç¨ on your first transfer of >300‚Ç¨ using [my referral link](https://bour.so/q23gRmkgW8). *For transparency: I would receive 30‚Ç¨.*


## Saxo
**Available accounts:** CTO, PEA, PEA-PME

The Pros:
- No required minimum transaction amount.
- Competitive fees: 0.08% with a minimum of $1 for US-traded stocks, 2‚Ç¨ for Paris/Amsterdam/Brussels.
- Fees for PEA: same as CTO but capped by law at 0.5% of the transacted amount.
- Comprehensive platform: stock charts, fundamentals, news. 
- Functionalities available for more advanced users: stock-screening, stop-loss, limits, alerts, trading signals etc.

The Cons:
- Platform can be slightly more complex that its competitors

**Comment**: ideal for opening a PEA.

Open an account and get 500‚Ç¨ of transactions fee offered during your first 90 days using [my referral link](https://www.home.saxo/fr-fr/accounts/openaccount#refcode=JY%2bEjiq1oqtfdjMEFSDgyxC5YggtcQIx%2bwpiMZXayqludSIt%2f3hKXCpe2oCPZkjU&refid=55c1c8b5-c20b-4b36-8f08-e05110bada8f). *For transparency: I would enjoy the exact same benefits as you.*


## Degiro
**Available accounts:** CTO

The Pros:
- Wide choice of stocks and ETFs.
- Transaction fee: 2‚Ç¨ for French, Canadian and US stocks.
- Preview of impending dividends.
- Detailed charts and company data.

The Cons:
- Significant increase in transaction fees: from 0.5‚Ç¨ to 1‚Ç¨ in 2022, to 2‚Ç¨ in 2023.
- Foreign broker: account has to be declared when filing your taxes.
- No IFU (Imprim√© Fiscal Unique) that would simplify filing your taxes.
- Fee of 2.5‚Ç¨/year for each stock exchange you hold stocks from.


**Comment**: I no longer recommend Degiro.

If you still insist, you can open an account and get 100‚Ç¨ of transactions fee offered during your first 90 days using [my referral link](https://www.degiro.fr/parrainage/commencez-a-investir?id=15163681&utm_source=mgm). *For transparency: I would receive 50‚Ç¨ after you have accumulated 5‚Ç¨ of transaction fees.*

## Trade Republic
**Available accounts:** CTO

The Pros:
- Fractional shares available: you don't have to buy one entire share of a stock or ETF, you can buy as little as 1‚Ç¨ of it.
- Transaction fees of only 1‚Ç¨ per transaction, and 0‚Ç¨ when scheduling periodic investments (the best feature in my opinion). 
- ETF composition available in the app directly (for most of them).
- Cash in the account currently yield 4%/year when not invested.
- Crypto available

The Cons:
- Instant deposits using credit card possible, but charged 0.7%
- Graphs only show 5 year of price history

**Comment**: the #1 platform I would recommend to open a CTO.
