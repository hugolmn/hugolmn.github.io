How and when I started investing.


## Crypto

### Chapter 1
My first investments with money at stake dates back to 2013 with crypto-currencies. I put my savings into mining equipment (graphic cards) to mine Litecoin, Maxcoin, or to be lent on NiceHash. The deal was simple: I paid the electricity bill - essentially providing free heat - and could let my machine run 24/7 to pocket whatever profit I could generate. 

A recuring question I get is: "so you must be rich now?". Unfortunately not, my strategy was simply to mine and sell coins, without holding more than a few weeks. That was "easy-money" for a 15-year old, only requiring regular gaming equipment, electricity and an internet connection. The 2013-2014 period was the first talked-about crypto bubble, which ended-up crashing >80%. Mining was no longer a profitable activity in France due to electricity costs. Equipement quickly got sold on eBay, and that was the end of this chapter. Should I have held onto my coins? Easy to say in hindsight.

Hacks happened regularly, and still do. Most notably was Mt. Gox shutting down in february 2014 (the exchange represented 70% of BTC transactions back then). You can read more about crypto exchange hacks with this great summary from cointelegraph: [Link](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-exchange-hacks/). Retrospectively, I got lucky to be using one of the few exchanges that still has not beed hacked: Kraken. I could also have kept a few satoshis sleeping in a cold-storage wallet, but once again, crypto was not a mainstream thing. Most people had never heard of it. It was only considered as a massively speculative but economicaly unsignificant asset: the total crypto market cap topped $5B for the first time in late-2013, and climbed as high as $15B. It currently stands at â‚¬1.94T as I write these lines according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/fr/charts/).
