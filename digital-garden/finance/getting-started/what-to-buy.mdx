# What to buy

This page will describe 3 different approaches, in ascending order of execution difficulty.
- Easy: focusing on a single, wide encompassing ETF.
- Medium: focusing on a combination of ETFs to introduce a custom weighting for some regions or sectors.
- Advanced: introducing indivual stock positions into the mix, for a more active portfolio management.

## Easy

This first approach to investing is the most simple but quite likely generate attractive long-term returns.

This strategy would be appropriate for you if:
- you are not particularly interested into knowing more about the stock market details
- you would like to minimize the time dedicated to your investments
- you want to be invested quickly

In short, this "easy" strategy relies on investing regularly on global ETFs.
