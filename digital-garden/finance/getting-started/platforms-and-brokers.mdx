The Pros:
- Fractional shares available: you don't have to buy one entire share of a stock or ETF, you can buy as little as 1€ of it.
- Transaction fees of only 1€ per transaction, and 0€ when scheduling periodic investments (the best feature in my opinion). 
- ETF composition available in the app directly (for most of them).
- Cash in the account currently yield 4%/year when not invested.
- Crypto available

The Cons:
- Instant deposits using credit card possible, but charged 0.7%
- Graphs only show 5 year of price history

**Comment**: the #1 platform I would recommend to open a CTO.
